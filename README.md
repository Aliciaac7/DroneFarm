# DroneFarm
This is a Java project that controls the tasks that the Drone will do in order to keep the farm working
The software developed is an Agricultural Management system. This system allows farmers and their staff to track and manage functional aspects of a large-scale farm using a drone to check for pests, check security systems, check weather forecasts, calibrate equipment, check soil, seed the field, start harvest, and fertilize the crops.
